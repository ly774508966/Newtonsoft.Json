Newtonsoft.Json
===============

Unity3d-buildable version of Newtonsoft.Json that I use. Real repo here: http://json.codeplex.com/



Yep, you're pretty much on your own if you use this. 


But I'm occasionally active on irc - freenode #unity3d - if you desperately need help because there's something dreadful missing.
